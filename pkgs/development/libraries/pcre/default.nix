      The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular
      expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as
      Perl 5. PCRE has its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper
      functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API. The
      PCRE library is free, even for building proprietary software.
